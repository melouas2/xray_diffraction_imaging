# xray_diffraction_imaging
Coherent X-ray Diffraction Imaging is a method of obtaining the image of a sample without the use of optics
between the sample and the detector. One of its major flaws however, is that the exposure time for these small
samples to x-rays is relatively short before they are annihilated by the incident radiation.
The project was solely theoretical; the objectives were to derive the time dependent signal density function 
by applying basic quantum theory to a simple isolated hydrogen atom and then computing its exposure time to 
x-rayâ€™s using Matlab which simulated the expected outcome.
